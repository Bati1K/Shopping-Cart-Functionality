# Shopping Cart Functionality

This project focuses on implementing the core functionality for a storefront application, specifically the shopping cart features. The visual design of the storefront and the necessary JavaScript to connect your code to the visual elements have already been prepared.

## Project Description

In this project, I have implemented the following core functionalities:

- **Cart Functionality**: I added essential shopping cart features, including the ability to add products to the cart, increase and decrease item quantities, and remove products from the cart.

- **Checkout Functionality**: I implemented functionality to calculate the total cost of items in the cart and to simulate a payment process.

- **Receipt**: I added functionality to summarize the items in the cart and display the total amount due.
